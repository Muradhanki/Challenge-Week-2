## About The Project


https://muradhanki.github.io/Challenge-Week-2/

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

As per our assigment, I have been asked to create our own portfolio web applicaton for our own projects. We have been asked to follow the template below for the reference.

Being a a future front-end developer, I was in need of an portfolio to showcase my projects to prospective clients.

Therefore I have created a portfolio web application based on the items below to satisfy a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
